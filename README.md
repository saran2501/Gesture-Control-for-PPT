### README: Gesture-Controlled Presentation System  

---

# Gesture-Controlled Presentation System  
Control your presentations effortlessly with hand gestures! This Python-based tool uses **Google ML Kit**, **Mediapipe**, and **OpenCV** for real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition, allowing you to navigate PowerPoint slides without touching a keyboard or mouse.  

---

## 📌 **Features**  
- **Hand Gesture Controls**:  
  - **Thumb (Outward)**: Swipe right to move to the next slide.  
  - **Index + Middle Fingers (Up)**: Swipe left to go to the previous slide.  
  - **Index + Middle + Ring Fingers (Up)**: Exit the presentation.  
- **Always-on-Top Window**: The hand-tracking feed stays visible in a compact window, perfect for presentations.  
- **Real-Time Responsiveness**: Seamless gesture recognition for smooth navigation.

## 🔧 **Technologies Used**  
- **Python**: Core implementation.  
- **Google ML Kit**: Powers hand detection and tracking.  
- **Mediapipe**: Tracks and processes hand landmarks.  
- **OpenCV**: Handles image processing and displays the feed.  
- **PyAutoGUI**: Simulates keyboard inputs for slide navigation.

## 🚀 **How to Run**  

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```bash  

   git clone [https://github.com/saran2501/Gesture-Control-for-PPT.git]
   cd <repo-name>  
   ```  

2. **Install Dependencies**:  
   Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed, then run:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```
